    <section id='due-at-vs-planned-at' class="faq-block">
      <p class="faq-block__question">
        What is the difference between an Assignment's due at and planned at dates?
      </p>
      <p class="faq-block__answer">
        The due at date of an Assignment is the date the Assignment must be turned in or submitted in order to not be considered late by your teacher. This date is typically provided either by your teacher at time of assignment or by your course syllabus.
      </p>
      <p class="faq-block__answer">
        The planned at date of an Assignment is used by the iHomework 2's Planner when sorting and displaying in progress Assignments. This date represents when you plan to working on this Assignment and should be earlier in time than the due date (no waiting until the last minute!). For example: if you have an Assignment due on Friday and you know it will take you 2 days to finish, you should plan on starting this work on Wednesday.

    <section id='what-is-planner' class="faq-block">
      <p class="faq-block__question">
        What is the Planner?
      </p>
      <p class="faq-block__answer">
        The Planner offers an alternative view into your in-progress Assignments. The default Assignment list is a great way to browse all of your work and is sorted by due dates; however, when actually working on an Assignment it's always better to start early. The Planner allows you to set the date and time you need to <strong>start</strong> working on an Assignment in order to get it done before the due date.
      </p>
      <p class="faq-block__answer">
        By default, the Planner only shows in-progress Assignments. If you wish to view completed Assignments, you can view the Assignment list or the Assignments section of a Course.

    <section id='what-is-effort' class="faq-block">
      <p class="faq-block__question">
        What is an Assignment's effort field?
      </p>
      <p class="faq-block__answer">
        The Assignment effort field is an estimation of how difficult an Assignment is relative to other Assignments. For example: if an Assignment will only take a few minutes to complete it is most likely a '1' effort. However, if an Assignment will take 4 hours to complete, it is most likely a '5'. Assignments that take a significant amount of effort might be better off split into multiple Assignments.
      </p>
      <p class="faq-block__answer">
        By default, iHomework 2 uses a Fibonacci sequence for effort values. Effort values are useful for planning purposes and more be more strictly enforced in future releases.
