          Protecting your privacy is incredibly important to us. This Privacy Policy explains our policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and transfer of your information when you use our Services. By using iHomework, you accept and agree to our information practices described below.
        </p>

    <section class="terms-block">
      <h2 class="terms-block__title">Security</h2>
      <p>
        When interacting with your iHomework account through our application on any platform, all requests are sent over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure">HTTPS</a> in order to protect your information.

      <h2>Collection and Use of Information</h2>
      <p>
        When you sign up for an iHomework account you must provide an email address. We require your email address for the following reasons:
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your email address can be used to sign into your iHomework account from multiple devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Should you forget your password, the email address associated with your account can be used to reset it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your email address is never shared with any third parties.</p>
      <p>
        After creating your iHomework account, you may optionally provide personally identifiable information ("PII"), which is information that can be used to identify or contact you. This information includes your name, where you go to school, and your current grade. This information is not shared with any third parties. We reserve the right to use this information in the future to connect you with iHomework users that share common PII.
      </p>

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>
        iHomework adheres and upholds the regulations set forth in the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule">Children's online protection and privacy act.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        You must be at least 13 years old to create an iHomework account. For users under the age of 13, the parent or guardian is responsible for understanding and agrees to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a school or organization recommends iHomework for use to users under the age of 13, they accept and agree to informing the parents or guardians of these responsibilities.
      </p>

      <h2>Password Protection</h2>
      <p>
        When you create an iHomework account, you must create a strong password. Passwords can be reset at any time by visiting the sign in screen and clicking "Forgot password?". When creating a password, keep in mind the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It is important to choose a strong password that is not easy for a computer or someone that knows you well to guess.
        </li>
        <li>
          The name of your pet, best friend or favorite sports team might not be a good choice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adding non-number/non-letter characters such as @, ?, #, $, % or ^ can help make your password harder to guess.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Passwords are encrypted and stored in our database(s). Your password will never be shared nor emailed to you. We will never ask you for your password in any form of communication other than when signing into your account.
      </p>
